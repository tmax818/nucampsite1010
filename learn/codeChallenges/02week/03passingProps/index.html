    <p>
      In the JS section of this Codepen is a React class component called App
      that contains some information about an upcoming party in its state. For
      the following challenges, you will only need to edit code in the JS
      section, not the HTML or CSS.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Challenge 1</strong>: Between the div tags at lines 18 and 20 of
        the JS section, render a component named
        <strong>&lt;Party&gt;</strong> and pass the partyType, entertainment,
        and venue properties from the state.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Challenge 2</strong>: Create/define a new React component named
        Party. In it, have it return a div that contains h3 tags surrounding the
        words Party Time!, followed by two paragraph elements that use the
        passed-in props. The first paragraph element will say: This _____ party
        will be held at ______ with a maximum capacity of ____. The second
        paragraph element will say: Featured entertainment: ______! The blanks
        will be filled in using props. See the screenshot in the learning portal
        page for this code challenge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Challenge 3</strong>: Add another property to the state in App,
        pass it as props to the Party component, and use it somewhere in the
        Party component. The property is up to you. Some examples: an array with
        a list of guest names, a cake flavor, the name of the birthday person,
        the address of the venue, etc!
      </li>
    </ul>
