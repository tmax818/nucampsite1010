    <title>Code Challenge: Lifting State Up & Functional Components</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <hr />
    <p>
      By now, you have learned about different component types, including
      function components and class components. In the JS section of this
      Codepen is an example of a class component named Welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Inside the JS section, create a class
      component named <strong>App</strong>. Inside its render() method, have it
      return the <strong>Welcome</strong> component. In the
      <strong>ReactDOM.render()</strong> method, change Welcome to App.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Lift the <strong>state</strong> from the
      Welcome component to App, so that the state is initialized inside of App's
      constructor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Convert the Welcome component to a
      <strong>function component</strong> that returns the same welcome message
      as before. You will need to pass the
      <strong>bootcampName</strong> property of state from App to the Welcome
      component. It's up to you whether or not to destructure it -- either is
      fine. Try it both ways for practice!
