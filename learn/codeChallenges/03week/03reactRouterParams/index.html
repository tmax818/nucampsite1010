    <p><strong>First:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the Albums link below, then click on Album 1 and Album 2 to
        observe the behavior.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Code Challenges:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add an album to the ALBUMSDATA array in the JS section. Hit the Run
        button, then click the Albums link and see how it's changed. This is a
        demo of how dynamic routing can work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, for the real challenge: You are invited to play around with the
        code and see what you can add - up to you. Some ideas: Add a component
        that displays albums by year, using a router parameter/match param for
        the year. Add a Random link that displays a random album. Display the
        album title along with "Album 1" and "Album 2". Add images and links to
        lyrics/MP3s... Up to you!
      </li>
    </ol>
