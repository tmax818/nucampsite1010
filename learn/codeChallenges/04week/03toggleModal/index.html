    <title>Code Challenge: Toggle Modal</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>This exercise is intended to give you practice with using React and Reactstrap to create a modal and toggle it.</p>
    <p>Much of the code is already written for you in the JS section. You only need to complete the code in the render/return section of the App component.</p>
    <ul><li><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Inside the React.Fragment returned from App, add a Reactstrap Button that, when clicked, will toggle the modal. You can use whatever text you like for the button, such as Click Me.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Next, also add a Reactstrap Modal that correctly passes the isModalOpen state and the toggle. Look at the modal you have already build in HeaderComponent.js for an example. There are no tricks here - this is not meant to be difficult, only to give you a closer look at the building blocks of a modal.</li>
      <li>Also add a ModalBody and some text inside it - whatever you like, 'Hello World' always works. You do not need a ModalHeader in this exercise.</li>
      <li>Test it and make sure it works. Because we're in a code playground here, you won't get a popup - you will see the modal appear on the same page as your button. That's OK.</li>
